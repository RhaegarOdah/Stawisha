# History

MED Mobile Ltd was incorporated in 2013 as a software services company with its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. The company’s mission is the delivery of a truly nation-wide, round the clock, convenient and efficient savings and credit financial service, delivered on an e-money platform to an all-inclusive customer base.
To date, the company operates the Timiza Vikoba service in Tanzania in collaboration with Maendeleo Bank PLC and Airtel Tanzania. The service is based on the company’s pioneer product, the Chama Mobile Software Application 1.0 (CMSA 1.0) which is a group banking software based on the Grameen microfinance methodology.
MED Mobile intends to shortly introduce a new product into the market. The product will be based on the CMSA 2.0 platform which is an enhanced version of our group banking software.
