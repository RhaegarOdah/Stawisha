    The Grameen Bank model works as follows: A bank is set up in a village with a field officer and some qualified bank workers. It will support 15 to 20 villagesâ€”the field officer will already have researched these villages as prospective clientele. Groups of five people are created. Two of the members are eligible to receive a loan. The two members are monitored for a one-month period, and the credibility of the group will then be based on the repayment performance of the two individuals. If the loans are paid back within the 50-week period, then 
the other members now qualify to receive a loan.
